        <h3>About us</h3>
        <h4>What do we do?</h4>
        Our specialty is statistical data analysis, but we do much more than that. Our goal is to give you a clear insight in your data 
		and tell the story behind the numbers.
		We can be part of the whole process of data gathering, data preparation, statistical analysis 
		and reporting or visualization of data. Also, we can coach people and give advice on how to do specific analyses.
		
		
		
		
		
<p>See <a href="#offering">Our services</a> for more information.</p>
		
		
		Some examples of what we do:
        <ul>
            <li>collect data with surveys
            <li>map data from the world wide web
            <li>design experiments 
			<li>merge messy data files into a clear data set
			<li>visualize patient data for group practices
			<li>look for associations between variables
			<li>look for trends during time
			<li>perform specialized statistical analyses
            <li>coach people to do statistical analyses 
			<li>help non-mathematical students with statistics
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>Who could we help?</h4>

        <p>
            We think we can help different people. 
			In fact, anyone who has (messy) data and wants to know the story behind it, or anyone who has a research question and does not know how to obtain this information can contact us.
			
		<p> We can work for nonprofit organizations, companies, group practices, scientists and students. 
			The subject of the data does not matter.
			</p>

        
            
     

        <h4>Experiences</h4>
        <p>
        Most of the data analysis is done by Dr. Ineke van Gremberghe (Master in Biotechnology, Master in Statistical Data
        Analysis, PhD in Biology). Ineke has worked at Ghent University as a biological scientist for six years and has experience with 
		designing and performing experiments, statistical analysis, reporting and coaching students. She is author of 15 scientific papers 
		and has given several presentations at international congresses.
		Ineke has done specialized data analysis at Ghent University, KU Leuven and for a psychological group practice. 
		She has most experience with descriptive analyses, regression analyses (e.g. general, generalized, multilevel,
		time series), multivariate analyses and causal mediation analyses.
        </p>

        <h3>Our services</h3>

        

        <h4>Data Gathering</h4>

        <p>When you have a research question but don’t have any data yet, we can help to collect data. We can for instance
            design experiments, gather data from surveys or collect data from the world wide web.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Preparation</h4>

        <p>When you have very ‘messy’ data (e.g. different excel or text files in different formats) we can create a clear
            data set for you. Data preparation involves data manipulation and data combining. Data
            manipulation involves performing various calculations and transformations to get the data in the desired
            format. Data combining is the process of integrating all data files. 
        </p>

        <h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>

        <p> An important part of our work is statistical data analysis. We normally work with the freely available software R, but can
            also work with SAS or SPSS. We have most experience with descriptive analyses, regression analyses (e.g. general, generalized, multilevel,
            time series), multivariate analyses and causal mediation analyses, but other statistical methods can also be done. 
        </p>

        <h4>Data Visualization and Reporting</h4>

        <p>Data visualization is very important in understanding the story within your data. We visualize your data by clear figures, which is part of the descriptive analyses.
		All statistical analyses performed and the results obtained are explained in a detailed report, and/or a presentation is given if preferred. </p>
			
		<h4>Teaching and Advice</h4>

        <p> We can give advice on which statistical methods you should use and teach how to do specific analyses in practice. 
		Also, a presentation on a statistical subject can be given for a group. 

			Statistics is not an easy course for some students with few mathematical background. We can help students who
            follow non-mathematical studies by teaching statistics or helping them with statistical analyses.
